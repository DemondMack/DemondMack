<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª SOC Analyst Projects:</h2>

<b>Security Operations Center Home Lab</b>

In this project, I set up a fully functioning Security Operations Center (SOC) homelab, where I deployed and configured SIEM tools, monitored network traffic, and simulated attacks to test incident response processes.
  - [Created a logical diagram](https://github.com/DemondMack/SecurityOperationsCenterHomeLab)
  - [Setup & Configured ELK](https://github.com/DemondMack/SecurityOperationsCenterHomeLab)
  - [Attacked a sytem to detect & investigate suspicious/malicious activity (SSH, RDP, Bruteforce)](https://github.com/DemondMack/SecurityOperationsCenterHomeLab)
  - [Created alerts & dashboards](https://github.com/DemondMack/SecurityOperationsCenterHomeLab)
  - [Setup and intergrated ticketing system](https://github.com/DemondMack/SecurityOperationsCenterHomeLab)
    
  <b>Splunk BOTS (Boss Of The SOC 1,2,3) Lab Project</b>
  
  Participated in challenging scenarios simulating real-world cybersecurity incidents using Splunk. Analyzed log sources, crafted complex queries to identify malicious activity, and detected advanced threats, including APT attacks.

  <b>WireShark Traffic Analysis</b>

   Captured and analyzed network traffic to identify potential threats, such as malware infections, suspicious communications, and abnormal patterns. 
  - [Identified scan patterns for different Nmap scan types](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Sentinel-Lab)
  - [Correlated suspicious ARP activity with IP addresses and MAC addresses](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Jwipe.PowerShell)
  - [Applied filters for DHCP, NetBIOS, and Kerberos to extract host and user details](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS)
  - [Identified ICMP and DNS tunneling patterns](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/PowerShell-Integrity-FIM)
  - [Investigated cleartext & encrypted  protocol traces(FTP, HTTP,HTTPS traffic)](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/PowerShell-Integrity-FIM)
